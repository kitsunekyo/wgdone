## Stack

Its running a frontend only PWA, and just requires a firebase storage. All CRUD operations are done directly against the firebase api, via the angularFire sdk.

You only need to setup a collection named `tasks` with a set of tasks.

example:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "Staubwischen"
    },
    {
      "name": "Staubsaugen",
      "meta": {
        "type": "select",
        "select_label": "Raum",
        "select_options": ["Wohnzimmer", "Schlafzimmer", "Esszimmer"]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "WÃ¤sche Waschen",
      "meta": {
        "type": "input"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
